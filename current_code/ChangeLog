 0.7.3.1  This version works for a quick and dirty build of a debian package 
	for amd64 architecture. Check the known buglist in the webcontent for known
	bugs of this version. 


	Remark: A major change compared to the version 0.7.3 of opendias 
	is the capability to run the opendias daemon as a non root user. The 
	build process is not yet flexible enought to handle different target 
	users. Currently the username intended to execute the daemon is named 
	opendias. It is under the reponsibility of the administrator to create 
	this user before installation of the package, otherwise the daemon
	is intended to be executed by root, but the rc script openDIAS does 
	not reflect that matter and must be changed manaully in a proper way.

	Find below a list of changes compared to version 0.7.3.
	+ vprintf issue in i_printf solved
	+ missing / in root request url fixed
	+ change reasonable resolution limitation for ocr
	+ added document attribute document hardcopy kept
	+ added some debugging o_log calls
	+ fixed segmentation violation at debug mode shutdown
	+ fixed documentation encoding problem in docDetails page ocr text. UTF-8 out 
	  of the database was not correctly rendered in response rendered in doc_editor.c
	+ changed evaluation of highest resolution supported by the scanner attached. 
	  sod->constraint.word_list cannot be assumed ordered. 
	+ recodniced TODO: resolution selection sliders shall only offer resolution 
	  steps which are supported by the appropriate scanner device.
	+ added flexible paths to autobuild
	+ changed requirement for opendias to be executed as root, which is still possible. 
	  The openDIAS user "opendias" is expected by the rc-script. The build process needs 
	  to be enhenced to keep the openDIAS user flexible. See remark above.
	+ added buglist to the webcontent to show known bugs 
	+ added non flexible rc script derived from ubuntu rc-script as template
	+ added DESTDIR support to automake to ease debian package build
	+ added control file of the deb creation process.
